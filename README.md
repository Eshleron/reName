reNamer lets you rename files depending on their extension.

## How it works
reNamer allows you to rename files these ways:

- For every .extension in the target folder reNamer sets unique enumeration.

## Where can use it?
 You can use that as a tool to rename you training dataset files.
 And simply you have a lot of files and you need the same pattern to rename them.
